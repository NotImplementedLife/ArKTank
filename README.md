# arKTank
A very basic shooter written in pygame

Found this on my hard drive. I wrote it in 2018 while learning python. 

## Controls

| Key           | Action             |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Arrows        | Move the tank      |
| A/D           | Rotate the turret  |
| S             | Shoot              |
| X             | Special ability (Automatic shoot) |
| C             | Special ability (Cardinal shoot)  |

Hint : Special abilities use Mana. For whatever reason it is limited to 20 (should be 100). It recharges when the next level is reached. More details are staying hidden in the code.

Enjoy!
